## Simple Usage
The `users` parameter accepts an array of objects. **key** value should be
defined which is equal to object variable we want to mention, in this case `username`.

`````javascript
$("#multi-users").mention({
    key: 'username',
    delimiter: '@',
    users: [{
        username: "ashley"
    }, { 
        username: "roger"
    }, { 
        username: "frecklefart123"
    }, {
        username: "jquery",
        delimiter: "#"
    }, {
        username: "plugin",
        delimiter: "#"
    }]
});
`````

## List of available Options

 key | yes | the object value in user's list representing the key | `'username'`
 image | yes | the object value in user's list representing the avatar image
 users | no | array containing user's objects | 
 sensitive | yes | reorder the mention list by the best candidate to lowest | `true`
 emptyQuery | yes | if set true, show mention list by typing delimiter character | `false`

 typeaheadOpts | yes | extra options for Twitter Bootstrap typeahead plugin | `{}`
 suffix	| yes | the charcter to suffix of return text | ` `
 useSuffix | yes | enable suffix for return text | `true`

## Options

### Sensitivity

With sensitivity set to true, items are ordered by the following divisions of priority:

* Highest: If first letter matches exactly
* High: If first letter matches regardless of case
* Med: If target has matching letters' case
* Low: if target has matching character regardless of case

### Overriding the delimiter:

You can override the delimitter for each array objects by defining `delimiter`
object value. for instance to have *developer* and *developing* hashtag we can
simple define extra delimiter value in each of them and set them to '#':

`````javascript
$("#multi-users").mention({
    delimiter: '@',
    users: [{
        username: "bob",
        name: "Bob Smith",
    }, { 
        username: "alice",
        name: "Alice Smith",
    }, { 
        username: "developer",
        name: "Developer",
        delimiter: "#"
    }, { 
        username: "developing",
        name: "Developing",
        delimiter: "#"
    }]
});
`````


### Sensitivity Examples:
If you were to query `"@r"`, with sensitivity on, the resulting list will be
`["roger", "Ricky", "sarah", "bigRat"]`, but if you were to query `"@R"`, the
resulting list would be `["Ricky", "roger", "bigRat", "sarah"]`


## Name, Username and Image Object's value
Object values of `name`, `username` and `image` in user's list will be shown
in mention list menu if defined. Username value is the one by selecting an
item, will be put into your textbox/input. username is required for this
script to work. each of these object values can be change to something else
by setting `key`, `name` or `image` option. 

`````javascript
$("#multi-users").mention({
    image: 'avatar',
    users: [{
        username: "bob",
        name: "Bob Smith",
        avatar: "http://placekitten.com/25/25"
    }, { 
        username: "alice",
        name: "Alice Smith",
        avatar: "http://placekitten.com/25/25"
    }]
});
`````

## Query
The `queryBy` parameter accepts an array of strings that represent keys in your
user object that you would like to query against. For example, if you were to
type in the `name` "@bob", the script would match the `username` "@bigCat". the
default value is equal to the value of `key` option.

## Empty Querying
You may query for users simply by pressing your delimiter. For example, pressing
the @ symbol will return all users that are a part of your users list, so long
as those users adhere to the `typeaheadOpts.items` limit
```javascript
$('#multi-users').mention({
    emptyQuery: true,
    typeaheadOpts: {
        items: 10 // Max number of items you want to show
    },
    users: [...]
});
```


## Defaults
`````javascript
$("#multi-users").mention({
    key: 'username',
    name: 'name',
    image: 'image',
    users: [], // Array of Objects
    delimiter: '@', // Username Delimiter
    delimiters: '', // Will be filled from user list delimiters
    sensitive : true,
    queryBy: ['username'],
    suffix : ' ',
    useSuffix : true,
    typeaheadOpts: { // Settings for Typeahead
        matcher: _matcher, // Mention.js's custom matcher function, don't change
        updater: _updater, // Mention.js's custom updater function, don't change
        sorter: _sorter, // Mention.js's custom sorter function, don't change
    }
});
 
`````
